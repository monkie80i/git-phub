	"intro": "As an ENTJ, your primary mode of living is focused externally, where you deal with things rationally and
logically. Your secondary mode is internal, where you take things in primarily via your intuition.
ENTJ's are natural born leaders. They live in a world of possibilities where they see all sorts of challenges
to be surmounted, and they want to be the ones responsible for surmounting them. They have a drive for
leadership, which is well-served by their quickness to grasp complexities, their ability to absorb a large
amount of impersonal information, and their quick and decisive judgments. They are "take charge" people.
ENTJ’s are very career-focused, and fit into the corporate world quite naturally. They are constantly
scanning their environment for potential problems which they can turn into solutions. They generally see
things from a long-range perspective, and are usually successful at identifying plans to turn problems
around - especially problems of a corporate nature. ENTJ’s are usually successful in the business world,
because they are so driven to leadership. They're tireless in their efforts on the job, and driven to visualize
where an organization is headed. For these reasons, they are natural corporate leaders.
There is not much room for error in the world of the ENTJ. They dislike seeing mistakes repeated, and have
no patience with inefficiency. They may become quite harsh when their patience is tried in these respects,
because they are not naturally tuned in to people's feelings, and more than likely don't believe that they
should tailor their judgments in consideration for people's feelings. ENTJ’s, like many types, have
difficulty seeing things from outside their own perspective. Unlike other types, ENTJ’s naturally have little
patience with people who do not see things the same way as the ENTJ. The ENTJ needs to consciously
work on recognizing the value of other people's opinions, as well as the value of being sensitive towards
people's feelings. In the absence of this awareness, the ENTJ will be a forceful, intimidating and
overbearing individual. This may be a real problem for the ENTJ, who may be deprived of important
information and collaboration from others. In their personal world, it can make some ENTJ’s overbearing
as spouses or parents.
The ENTJ has a tremendous amount of personal power and presence which will work for them as a force
towards achieving their goals. However, this personal power is also an agent of alienation and self-
aggrandizement, which the ENTJ would do well to avoid.",
	"intro_p": "ENTJ’s are very forceful, decisive individuals. They make decisions quickly, and are quick to verbalize
their opinions and decisions to the rest of the world. The ENTJ who has not developed their Intuition will
make decisions too hastily, without understanding all of the issues and possible solutions. On the other
hand, an ENTJ who has not developed their Thinking side will have difficulty applying logic to their
insights, and will often make poor decisions. In that case, they may have brilliant ideas and insight into
situations, but they may have little skill at determining how to act upon their understanding, or their actions
may be inconsistent. An ENTJ who has developed in a generally less than ideal way may become
dictatorial and abrasive - intrusively giving orders and direction without a sound reason for doing so, and
without consideration for the people involved.
Although ENTJ’s are not naturally tuned into other people's feelings, these individuals frequently have very
strong sentimental streaks. Often these sentiments are very powerful to the ENTJ, although they will likely
hide it from general knowledge, believing the feelings to be a weakness. Because the world of feelings and
values is not where the ENTJ naturally functions, they may sometimes make value judgments and hold
onto submerged emotions which are ill-founded and inappropriate, and will cause them problems -
sometimes rather serious problems.ENTJ’s love to interact with people. As Extroverts, they're energized and stimulated primarily externally.
There's nothing more enjoyable and satisfying to the ENTJ than having a lively, challenging conversation.
They especially respect people who are able to stand up to the ENTJ, and argue persuasively for their point
of view. There aren't too many people who will do so, however, because the ENTJ is a very forceful and
dynamic presence who has a tremendous amount of self-confidence and excellent verbal communication
skills. Even the most confident individuals may experience moments of self-doubt when debating a point
with an ENTJ.
ENTJ’s want their home to be beautiful, well-furnished, and efficiently run. They're likely to place much
emphasis on their children being well-educated and structured, to desire a congenial and devoted
relationship with their spouse. At home, the ENTJ needs to be in charge as much as he or she does in their
career. The ENTJ is likely best paired with someone who has a strong self-image, who is also a Thinking
type. Because the ENTJ is primarily focused on their careers, some ENTJ’s have a problem with being
constantly absent from home, physically or mentally.
The ENTJ has many gifts which make it possible for them to have a great deal of personal power, if they
don't forget to remain balanced in their lives. They are assertive, innovative, long-range thinkers with an
excellent ability to translate theories and possibilities into solid plans of action. They are usually
tremendously forceful personalities, and have the tools to accomplish whatever goals they set out for.",

	"success": "ENTJ people are realists, in the most basic sense of the word. Not only because their thinking is based upon
a clear view of how things actually are in the world around them, but also because their ideas and strategies
are structured around those unambiguous, “down to earth”, commonsense beliefs which sum up the
obvious and undeniable in life. But while ENTJ’s might be pragmatic about the immediate situation before
them, they are scarcely satisfied with it until it can be made more productive, useful or valuable. The
ENTJ’s reasoning on such matters is always clear and generally unemotional. If action can improve an item
or a situation then it ought to be taken, and the ENTJ will always be found in the midst of such action,
organizing, planning and leading the way forward until the best result possible has been realized. This
makes success for an ENTJ something that can be clearly seen, a real world result which can be measured.
And whether measured in dollars, bricks, bread or just happy people, the successful ENTJ knows the result
is due to their belief that it is just plain commonsense to try and make the best of every situation and get the
most out if it for the most people.",
	"s2f": "As an ENTJ, you have gifts that are specific to your personality type that aren't natural strengths for other
types. By recognizing your special gifts and encouraging their growth and development, you will more
readily see your place in the world, and be more content with your role. Nearly all ENTJ’s will recognize
the following characteristics in themselves. They should embrace and nourish these strengths:
Able to cut straight to the chase in any situation and not be sidetracked by non-essential issues.
A propensity for leadership which follows naturally from their ability to control and manage real
time/real world situations.
A talent for factual analysis unbiased by prejudice or emotion.
A “can do” approach to life which makes the working environment a positive place for them.
A strong regard for positive social and economic institutions, structure and government.
Second to none time and space management skills, everything organized and in its place.
Able to constantly synthesize and adapt new ideas and concepts into strategies for business, social,
financial or environmental development.
ENTJ’s who have a well-developed Introverted Intuitive function to complement their dominant
Extraverted Thinking will enjoy these very special gifts:
A talent for creating great benefits through the addressing of social justice issues.The ability to recognize and mediate their potentials in accord with the expectations of others.
An approach to life which includes an awareness of the differences between their needs and those
of others.
Able to know when to stop and take stock of life and recognize the qualities of the moment.
A talent for showing others the way to get past difficulties in their outer life
A broadening of their own ambitions which includes rather than excludes others from the decision
making and the benefits which flow from their achievement.",
	"pot_prob": "With any gift of strength, there is an associated weakness. Without "bad", there would be no "good".
Without "difficult", there would be no "easy". We value our strengths, but we often curse and ignore our
weaknesses. To grow as a person and get what we want out of life, we must not only capitalize upon our
strengths, but also face our weaknesses and deal with them. That means taking a hard look at our
personality type's potential problem areas.
ENTJ’s are strong, right minded and rational people. This should be kept in mind as you read some of the
more negative material about ENTJ weaknesses. These weaknesses are natural. We offer this information
to enact positive change, rather than as blatant criticism.
Most of the weaker characteristics in the ENTJ stem from their dominant Extraverted Thinking function
overtaking their personality, stifling the natural expression and balancing value of the other personality
functions. In such cases, an ENTJ may show some or all of the following weaknesses in varying degrees:
May be unable to understand other people’s needs where these differ from their own.
May unwisely assume their ideas are the only right ones and are therefore being fully implemented
by others.
May become childishly petulant or angered when confronted by situations which require feeling
judgments.
May become so engrossed in a plan or ambition that personal needs and the needs of others are
forgotten.
May take every decision not made in agreement with their rational beliefs as a personal rejection.
May be easily taken in or manipulated by others via agreement with their rational attitudes.
May become obsessed with small obstructions and difficulties to the point where the overall plan
is forgotten
May believe natural limitations are actually ailments which ought to be eradicated
May assume others are ever plotting against them.
May believe only their own view of the world or a situation is correct, even to the point that they
make it into a kind of dogma which must be followed by those around them",
	"solns": "To grow as an individual, the ENTJ needs to recognize the role Intuition plays in their life, and learn to
understand its language. In particular the ENTJ needs to realize that their intuitive function is not directed
outward to the world, that its images are personal, subjective and relate directly to the way the ENTJ’s
inner self is being affected by both the outside world and their own behavior.
Introverted Intuition is not an obvious process to understand, and quite unlike the rational, straightforward
thinking the ENTJ is used to. Nevertheless, if understood and fully utilized to support thinking, it can make
the ENTJ the most outwardly effective and productive of all the personality types. For this reason it is
essential to allow this gift to become what it can be, rather than limiting its talents and allowing it only to
speak when it seems to agree with the ENTJ’s outwardly focused thinking. Below are a few specific
suggestions to help you apply Introverted Intuition.
When confronted by a situation which requires an important decision, try to put it off for long enough to be
able to sit quietly with it. In doing so allow yourself to feel and see the images which arise in your mind
regarding this situation. Try to set aside those which appear immediately as the products of your own
beliefs and thinking, and regard the others closely. If these images and ideas were the opinions of people
whose judgment you trusted implicitly, try to question them in your mind and find the reasons why they
consider things in such a way.
There are some people around you who always seem to know just which way to go or how things work or
what the outcome of a certain situation will be without them seeming to have sufficient information to be
able to do so. These people are intuitive types and their world is full of possibilities which they can
immediately recognize as apt to certain situations. You also have this talent, but you have a habit of not
following it, rather you prefer to think it out and find the options which “ought” to be correct. I placed
ought in quotes for a very good reason here, for you know yourself how often things have developed in the
direction you had an inkling of, but refused to accept without thinking. Try to let these immediate
impressions have their moment and recognize them as true possibilities which ought to be examined more
closely. Understand that they are not baseless images and ideas but rely upon valid sources of information
which you simply screen out of your life by habit.",
	"living_happy": "Some ENTJ’s have difficulty fitting into our society. Their problems are generally associated with a
strongly dogmatic and overly rational approach to life, coupled with an almost total lack of ability tounderstand the needs of others. Where such a strongly expressing difficulty arises, the ENTJ finds
themselves constantly embattled by a world which refuses to conform to their ideals and creates situations
in which the ENTJ is out of their depth. Such situations are often met by the ENTJ with such a childish
emotionality that others are put off and isolate the ENTJ emotionally. Such ENTJ’s often find themselves
without friends, and with business partners or employees who are unwilling to engage the ENTJ upon any
matter other than strictly task related questions. Such behavior in others only serves to bring out underlying
sentiments in the ENTJ which, via their badly adapted intuitive function, speak to them of plots, nastiness
and covert obstructive behavior on the part of others. Suffice to say, such suspicions and childish
sentiments coupled with dogmatic demands to conform to the ENTJ’s own way of seeing the world can
soon destroy families and close relationships.
It is incumbent upon the ENTJ to break the circle of such behavior by allowing their Introverted Intuition a
place in their life. Through attention to this function the ENTJ can discover a path to understanding and
recognizing the effects not only their own behavior has upon others, but also the greater possibilities which
lie within themselves for not only a harmonious relationship with others, but also a greater sense of what
might be best for themselves.
Understanding the feeling needs and judgments of others is not an easy task for the ENTJ, but through their
Intuitive function they can find images and ideas which - whilst not speaking directly to the feeling
judgments of others – might allow them to see outside the strictly rational circle of their world view in such
a way as to recognize that there is indeed a different perspective which must be taken account of.",
	"rules": "1. Feed Your Strengths! Give yourself every opportunity to show others your appreciation of a
situation and how you could see it through to a good outcome. Take charge where you can make it
count.
2. Face Your Weaknesses! Understand you have limits too. Your careful world view is not the whole
deal. How things look and feel may not concern you, but they concern many others. Try and allow
such things to be and learn from them.
3. Talk Time to Find Out How Others Really Think. You need to drive past your thoughts with
others and let their appreciations of a situation reach you at a deeper level. It will then be possible
for you to take account of their needs as real world objectives which if included in your ideas will
bring greater harmony and quality to life and relationships.
4. Take Time Out To Let The Whole Situation Speak To You. Don't dismiss those abstract and
seemingly hard to understand or bothersome aesthetic and feeling judgments coming from others
or from inside yourself. Drop everything for a while, stop thinking and worrying and just relax
into those ideas and let them speak to you. Perhaps they can be accommodated, perhaps
something is hiding in there which offers a new way
5. When You Get Upset, You Lose. Your energy and rational understandings are strong assets, but
can be very harmful if they turn against you and leave you with nothing but emotions you cannot
deal with. Remember that others cannot always be expected to fall into your ways of seeing, and
when your drive to make them do so fails you will suffer feelings of resentment and even
abandonment. You cannot deal with the world like this. Moderate your ideas, allow others their
spaces, and you will grow.
6. Respect your need for intellectual compatibility. Don't expect yourself to be a "touchy-feely" or
"warm-fuzzy" person. Realize that your most ardent bonds with others will start with the head,
rather than the heart. Be aware of other's emotional needs, and express your genuine love and
respect for them in terms that are real to YOU. Be yourself.
7. Be Accountable for Yourself. Don't blame the problems in your life on other people. Look
inwardly for solutions. No one has more control over your life than you have.
8. Be Humble. Judge yourself at least as harshly as you judge others.
9. Take a Positive Approach to Differences in People. Don't distress yourself and others by dwelling
on what seem to be their limitations. They need you to guide them and you need them to see
things through. Try and recognize who can perform the most ably within certain fields outside
your own competence. Let the feelings of others become a strength rather than a hindrance to you.10. Don't Get Obsessed! Recognize the value that personal world has to you, your friends, your
family, your own inner sense of self worth and life. Take pride in just being a good person and
don’t allow external situations to control you. Try to relax and let the moment belong to the best
things you can find in others and yourself. Nothing out there is more important than your own
happiness",
